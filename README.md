# About my Project "Developing a System for Managing the Registration and Evaluation Process of Graduation Theses"
- The system has 5 main actors, including Students, Lecturers, Supervising Lecturers, the Head of Department and Admin.

`Some notable features include:`

- Students can register for available topics on the system and view detailed evaluation results of their topics from supervising lecturers, reviewers, and the council/poster.
- Lecturers can create topics to submit for approval by the Head of Department and participate in evaluating and grading when assigned by the Head of Department.
- The Head of Department approves topics, assigns roles and tasks, and evaluates and grades.
- The Supervising Lecturer has similar responsibilities to a regular lecturer but is assigned roles and tasks by the Head of Department.
- The Admin manages user accounts and assigns user roles.
